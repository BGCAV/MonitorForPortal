processMonitorRunningSportsManSQL.cmd       It's the primary script that's called by Task Scheduler to perform monitoring
                                            of SportsManSQL's Portal process.  Configures processMonitorRunning.cmd with
                                            these specific SportsManSQL settings:
                                            - Name of process to monitor.
                                            - Name of program/script that starts the monitored process.
                                            - Name of program/script that analyzes the process' log

                                            - processMonitorRunning.cmd
                                            - processStartSportsManSQL.cmd
                                            - logAnalyzerSportsManSQL.cmd

processMonitorRunning.cmd                   Implements the processing monitoring framework.  This framework determines if
                                            the configured "process" is currently running.  If not, it starts this process by
                                            executing a provided program/script.  The framework then executes the configured
                                            log analyzer.  The analyzer determines the "disposition" of monitored process.  If
                                            it suggests that the process would benefit from a restart, the framework performs
                                            this restart.

processShutdown.cmd                         Terminates a running process using its process id.  First attempts to gracefully
                                            end task allotting it a grace period to finish.  If it fails to terminate
                                            within this grace period, it is immediately terminated. 

processStartSportsManSQL.cmd                A script that starts SportsManSQL's Portal process.  It calls dnsResolutionCheckPeakSoftware.cmd
                                            to ensure network connectivity before attempting to start Portal.exe.

                                            - Portal.exe

logAnalyzerSportsManSQL.cmd                 Analyzes the SportsManSQL's Portal process' log.  It determines if this process would
                                            benefit from a restart.  It is the one of the arguments bound/configured
                                            by processMonitorRunningSportsManSQL.cmd

                                            - fileTxtTail.cmd

dnsResolutionCheckPeakSoftware.cmd          Configures dnsResolutionCheck.cmd with specific SportsManSQL dns request and applies an exponential
                                            back off algorithm until network connectivity is established and Peak Software's gateway url is 
                                            properly resolved to a responsive IP.

                                            - dnsResolutionCheck.cmd
                                            - retryCommandExponentialBackoff.cmd

dnsResolutionCheck.cmd                      Tests IP network connectivity by first pinging a static, reliable IP address.  It then
                                            issues another ping using a specific URL.

retryCommandExponentialBackoff.cmd          A script that attempts to start the provided program/script until it successfully completes.
                                            Attempts are exponentially spaced after each successive failure until this interval exceeds
                                            an upper limit.  Once reached, this limit becomes the retry (space) interval.

dateMath.cmd                                Offers various date functions, like computing an interval, in days, between dates.

fileTxtTail.cmd                             Provides rudimentary linux "tail" function.

taskSchedulerSportsManSQLMonitor.xml        XML used to create the periodic task that executes processMonitorRunningSportsManSQL.cmd.
                                            It defines various task attributes of this task, such as, it frequency.  The frequency/
                                            interval between executions should be greater than:
                                            - The time necessary to start the process added to
                                            - the time necessary to terminate the process.
                                            The SportsManSQL startup process typically requires ~30 seconds to completely prepare the
                                            server to accept connections.
