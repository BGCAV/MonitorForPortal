Required Resource:
- login to Utility Machine.
- Download MonitorForPortal from BGCAV github into SportsManSQLServer config directory. 
  - Need: personal cell phone & github credentials
Install Instructions
- Create directory: "C:\Users\%username%\Desktop\sportsManSQLPortalProcessMonitor\Package"
- Create directory: "C:\Users\%username%\Desktop\sportsManSQLPortalProcessMonitor\Log"
- Copy "Package\" from SportsManSQLServer config directory to "C:\Users\%username%\Desktop\sportsManSQLPortalProcessMonitor\Package"
- View:
    - processStartSportsManSQL.cmd ensure the following are correct:
      - title on "start" command: "portal.exe"
      - start path to portal.exec process is correct
    - dnsResolutionCheckPeakSoftware.cmd ensure following are correct:
      - "gateway.activityreg.com" is specified as dnsResolutionCheck.cmd's first argument.
    - processMonitorRunningSportsManSQL.cmd
      -"portal.exe" "processStartSportsManSQL.cmd" "logAnalyzerSportsManSQL.cmd" 60 as processMonitorRunning.cmd arguments
- Task Manager Import XML:  
  - C:\Users\%username%\Desktop\sportsManSQLPortalProcessMonitor\Package\taskSchedulerSportsManSQLMonitor.xml
  - Ensure the scheduler:
    - Doesn't start more than one concurrent instance of this task.  A previous instance of this
      task may be running due to a network connectivity issue that hasn't been resolved.
    - It's frequency - period between executions, is greater than the intervals required to start
      and potentially terminate the process.  At this time, this frequency should be =>3min and <=10min.
      Additionally, the task's frequency must be fast enough to detect a "relevant" log entry. Currently,
      only one log entry indicating a connection failure triggers the restart of Portal.exe.  This log entry
      is repeated every second for a few hours.  Therefore, a frequency of 5min during the first few hours 
      will always detect this error because the current log entry will be at most 1 second old.  Furthermore,
      the log analyzer isn't currently "smart enough" to ignore the last log entry it reviewed to 
      arrive at its decision.  Therefore, the frequency must be long enough, so the "current" relevant log
      entry isn't considered relevant again when this task executes.  The SportsManSQL log analyzer reviews
      messages issued within 10sec of when it's executed.
    - Given the above constraints, a frequency of 5min seems sensible.  As it satisfies a two minute start
      and termination cycle, will attempt to restart the task 12 times/hour, whenever it starts during the
      first 3-4 hours, if the failure is related to DNS, there should be a relevant log entry, the
      interval is long enough to "forget" the prior relevant log entry that triggered the last
      attempted restart, and finally, it's quick enough so individuals using the website and the Club's staff
      don't become impatient.
- TestInstallation:
  - disable network connection.
  - After network failure causes Portal restart, enable network connection
  - Process monitor should attempt to restart Portal process.
  - Once the above successfully completes, Shutdown SportsManSQL.
  - Restart SportsManSQL.
  - Portal process monitor should successfully restart the Portal.
- if all works as expected perform permanent install:
  - shutdown SportsManSQL.
  - revert its image
  - reinstall portal process monitor
  - shutdown SportsManSQL
  - Create new snapshot.
  - Restart SportsManSQL - process monitor should properly start it..
